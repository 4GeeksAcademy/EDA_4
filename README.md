# Sinopsis

## Objective
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis and cleansing of a dataset, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ultimately, the training of a machine learning model. The provided dataset is extensive, featuring numerous rows and columns, and lacks a predefined objective. Consequently, the determination of the target for the model rests on the project creator. The primary goal is to predict the probability of encountering a heart-related problem based on various factors, including other diseases, hospital agents available in the country, and income levels. It is essential to note that the context of this analysis pertains to the American healthcare system, characterized by its private nature.
## Scope
The scope of the project encompasses three main phases: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model training. The data cleaning phase involves the meticulous examination and enhancement of the dataset to ensure its suitability for subsequent analysis. The EDA phase aims to unravel insights and patterns within the data, providing a foundation for informed decision-making. Lastly, the machine learning model is trained to predict the likelihood of heart problems based on selected features.
## Dataset Overwiev
The dataset provided for analysis is characterized by its substantial size, with numerous rows and columns. As no predefined objective is supplied, the choice of the target variable for the machine learning model is a crucial decision in this project. The diverse nature of the dataset allows for a comprehensive exploration of potential correlations between heart problems and various influencing factors.
## Target Variable Selection
Given the absence of a specified target variable, the decision is made to predict the probability of heart-related issues. The selected features for prediction include the presence of other diseases, the availability of hospital resources in the country, and income levels. It is imperative to consider the unique context of the American healthcare system, where the private nature of healthcare services adds an additional layer of complexity to the analysis.

## Conclusion
This project aims to contribute valuable insights into the relationship between heart problems and a range of influencing factors within the context of the American healthcare system. By employing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques, the objective is to create a predictive model that enhances our understanding of the factors contributing to heart-related issues.
